# Momentum
This is the code repository for the semester project submitted for SYDE 673 course at the University of Waterloo. The objective is to improve the performance of traditional detection based tracking algorithms under occlusion. This is done by estimating the trajectory of the object using previous frames, and predicting where it could be in the new frame in case the detection-based tracking algorithm fails.
